# Conversation: Creating an API for S3-hosted HTML Files with Metadata Management

## Initial Request

**Human:** Give me a step-by-step guide. I have to create an API in Node.js using Express.js and MongoDB. If needed, first I have a folder with information of images which is in JSON and HTML format which render in iframe. Like in folder name dim12-08-24, in this folder all JSON files and HTML files are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. I have to make an API endpoint in which I pass the folder name and it simply returns the HTML file.

**Assistant:** Here's a step-by-step guide to create an API in Node.js using Express.js and MongoDB to serve HTML files from an Amazon S3 bucket based on a folder name:

1. Set up your project:
   ```
   mkdir your-api-project
   cd your-api-project
   npm init -y
   ```

2. Install necessary dependencies:
   ```
   npm install express mongodb aws-sdk dotenv
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory to store your environment variables:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
   AWS_REGION=your_aws_region
   S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_s3_bucket_name
   ```

4. Create an `app.js` file in the root directory:

```javascript
require('dotenv').config();
const express = require('express');
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');

const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Configure AWS
AWS.config.update({
  accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
  secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
  region: process.env.AWS_REGION
});

const s3 = new AWS.S3();

// MongoDB connection
let db;

async function connectToMongoDB() {
  const client = new MongoClient(process.env.MONGODB_URI);
  await client.connect();
  db = client.db('your_database_name');
  console.log('Connected to MongoDB');
}

// API endpoint
app.get('/api/folder/:folderName', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const folderName = req.params.folderName;
    
    // Check if folder exists in MongoDB (optional step)
    const folder = await db.collection('folders').findOne({ name: folderName });
    if (!folder) {
      return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Folder not found' });
    }

    // Get HTML file from S3
    const params = {
      Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET_NAME,
      Key: `${folderName}/index.html` // Assuming the HTML file is named index.html
    };

    s3.getObject(params, (err, data) => {
      if (err) {
        console.error(err);
        return res.status(500).json({ error: 'Error fetching HTML file from S3' });
      }

      // Set appropriate headers
      res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');
      res.send(data.Body.toString('utf-8'));
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });
  }
});

// Start the server
async function startServer() {
  await connectToMongoDB();
  app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
  });
}

startServer();
```

5. Run your API:
   ```
   node app.js
   ```

This API does the following:

1. Sets up an Express.js server.
2. Configures AWS SDK with your credentials.
3. Connects to MongoDB.
4. Creates an API endpoint `/api/folder/:folderName`.
5. When a request is made, it checks if the folder exists in MongoDB (optional step).
6. Fetches the HTML file from the S3 bucket using the folder name.
7. Sends the HTML file as the response.

To use this API:
1. Make sure your S3 bucket contains folders with HTML files (e.g., `dim12-08-24/index.html`).
2. Send a GET request to `http://localhost:3000/api/folder/dim12-08-24`.
3. The API will return the HTML file content, which can be rendered in an iframe.

Note: This example assumes the HTML file in each folder is named `index.html`. Adjust the S3 key in the `getObject` params if your file naming convention is different.

Would you like me to explain any part of this code in more detail?

## Follow-up Question

**Human:** Like I have to upload folder on s3 with extra information like I have excel sheet which include folder name and extra information like product details, product Id, show details or not (boolean) how to manage this with excel sheet

**Assistant:** I understand you want to upload folders to S3 and manage additional information from an Excel sheet. Let's create a script to handle this process. We'll use Node.js with the AWS SDK for S3 operations, the `xlsx` library to parse the Excel file, and MongoDB to store the metadata.

Here's a step-by-step guide with a script to accomplish this:

1. First, make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

```
npm install aws-sdk xlsx mongodb dotenv
```

2. Create a `.env` file in your project root to store sensitive information:

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
AWS_REGION=your_aws_region
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_s3_bucket_name
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```

3. Now, let's create a script to handle the upload process and metadata management:

```javascript
require('dotenv').config();
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const XLSX = require('xlsx');
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

// Configure AWS
const s3 = new AWS.S3({
  accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
  secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
  region: process.env.AWS_REGION
});

// MongoDB connection
let db;

async function connectToMongoDB() {
  const client = new MongoClient(process.env.MONGODB_URI);
  await client.connect();
  db = client.db('your_database_name');
  console.log('Connected to MongoDB');
}

async function uploadFileToS3(filePath, s3Key) {
  const fileContent = fs.readFileSync(filePath);
  const params = {
    Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET_NAME,
    Key: s3Key,
    Body: fileContent
  };

  try {
    await s3.upload(params).promise();
    console.log(`Uploaded ${s3Key} to S3`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error uploading ${s3Key}:`, error);
  }
}

async function uploadFolderToS3(folderPath, s3FolderName) {
  const files = fs.readdirSync(folderPath);

  for (const file of files) {
    const filePath = path.join(folderPath, file);
    const s3Key = `${s3FolderName}/${file}`;
    await uploadFileToS3(filePath, s3Key);
  }
}

async function processExcelAndUpload(excelFilePath, baseFolderPath) {
  const workbook = XLSX.readFile(excelFilePath);
  const sheetName = workbook.SheetNames[0];
  const sheet = workbook.Sheets[sheetName];
  const data = XLSX.utils.sheet_to_json(sheet);

  for (const row of data) {
    const { folderName, productId, productDetails, showDetails } = row;
    const folderPath = path.join(baseFolderPath, folderName);

    // Upload folder to S3
    await uploadFolderToS3(folderPath, folderName);

    // Store metadata in MongoDB
    await db.collection('folders').updateOne(
      { folderName },
      {
        $set: {
          productId,
          productDetails,
          showDetails: showDetails.toLowerCase() === 'true',
          s3Path: `${process.env.S3_BUCKET_NAME}/${folderName}`
        }
      },
      { upsert: true }
    );

    console.log(`Processed folder: ${folderName}`);
  }
}

async function main() {
  await connectToMongoDB();

  const excelFilePath = 'path/to/your/excel/file.xlsx';
  const baseFolderPath = 'path/to/your/base/folder';

  await processExcelAndUpload(excelFilePath, baseFolderPath);

  console.log('Upload and metadata storage complete');
  process.exit(0);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

Here's how to use this script:

1. Replace `'path/to/your/excel/file.xlsx'` with the actual path to your Excel file.
2. Replace `'path/to/your/base/folder'` with the path to the directory containing all your folders to upload.

3. Ensure your Excel file has the following columns:
   - folderName: Name of the folder to upload
   - productId: Product ID associated with the folder
   - productDetails: Details about the product
   - showDetails: Boolean value ('TRUE' or 'FALSE') indicating whether to show details

4. Run the script:
   ```
   node upload-script.js
   ```

This script does the following:
1. Connects to MongoDB
2. Reads the Excel file
3. For each row in the Excel file:
   - Uploads the corresponding folder to S3
   - Stores the metadata (productId, productDetails, showDetails) in MongoDB

The metadata in MongoDB will have this structure:
```json
{
  "folderName": "example-folder",
  "productId": "ABC123",
  "productDetails": "Some product details",
  "showDetails": true,
  "s3Path": "your-bucket-name/example-folder"
}
```

You can then use this metadata in your API to control access to the S3 files and provide additional information when serving the HTML files.

Would you like me to explain any part of this process in more detail or help you with creating an API to serve this data?
